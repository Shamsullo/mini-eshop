All the requirements which were give can are in the 'mini_shop_v1'. In the'mini_shop_v2' I started building this assigment with RESP API, so you as it is just started you can ignore it for now.


#### After cloning the project from Github, can follow these step to run the project in your computer locally.

1. create a vitual environment, probably by:
```bash
pip vitrualenv name_your_env
```
2. activate it in the folder wher you name_your_env located in windows with bash:
```bash
# Windows command:
source ./name_your_env/Scripts/activate

#bash command:
source ./name_your_env/bin/activate
```
3. then you need to install all the packages which is inside requirements.txt to your virtual environment. Make sure you are in the folder where requirements.txt saved
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. after that go and locate you manage.py file in the local server and run this command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
5. now, go to you browser and enter localhost in the search field
